  <p><b><i>Bhagalpur College of Engineering(B.C.E)</i></b>, Bhagalpur was set up by the Department Of Science and Technology, Government of
Bihar in the <b>year 1960</b> with a view to providing efficient system of technical education in Bihar.Earlier, the
affiliation was under <b><i>Tilkamanjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) Bhagalpur</i></b>, BIHAR which was later passed on to <b><i>Aryabhatta
Knowledge University (AKU), Patna</i></b> which was established by the government of Bihar, under <b><i>Bihar Act 24, 2008</i></b>. BCE is
administered by the Department of Science and Technology under the guidance of the government of Bihar.Since the
inception of this seat of learning, it has moved ahead with the singular aim of training the students in the field of
science and technology, not only the theoretical instructions scattered in hundreds of engineering books but also the
pragmatic, down-to-earth practical solutions of the innumerable Engineering problems faced by the working technocrats in
various Industries, R&D cells and Govt. departments. About 5000 Alumni, contributing to the cause of science and
technology in India and abroad in many important capacities, speak of the glorious tradition of B.C.E the justification
that quantity dulls the edge of quality and at least so the B.C.E.The institute offers full-time Bachelor of Technology
(B.Tech) degree programs in disciplines of science and technology viz. Computer Science & Engineering, Electronics &
Communication Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering.</p>
